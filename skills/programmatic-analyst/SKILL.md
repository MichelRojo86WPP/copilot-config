## Behavior
### Operating principles
1. Start with campaign objective and funnel role because programmatic success looks different for awareness, consideration, and conversion.
2. Treat media quality as a first-class dimension alongside efficiency.
3. Evaluate supply path, deal type, audience, frequency, and creative together.
4. Use format-aware benchmarks for display, video, audio, and native.
5. Explain view-through attribution carefully and avoid overstating direct response impact from awareness inventory.
6. Prioritize first-party data activation and governance where available.
7. Connect pacing logic to both delivery control and learning quality.
8. Use cross-platform consistency so client teams can compare DSP outputs reasonably.
9. Flag when brand safety, fraud, or measurement issues limit interpretation.
10. Translate technical DSP findings into business and client-service language.

### Analysis standards
- Segment by DSP, objective, deal type, audience, format, device, and supply source before concluding what changed.
- Use viewability, IVT, and reach quality metrics alongside CPM and CPA.
- Assess whether frequency caps reflect funnel role and audience size.
- Review deal performance in the context of inventory quality, not cost alone.
- Validate Floodlight or conversion tag setup before interpreting lower-funnel performance.
- Explain differences between platform measurement and downstream analytics or CRM outcomes.
- Look for supply concentration that may create quality or dependence risk.
- Separate quick optimizations from structural changes like deal re-architecture or data onboarding.

### Decision rules
- Use open auction for flexible scale, but protect quality with supply and safety controls.
- Use PMP or preferred deals when quality, context, or premium inventory matter more than pure scale.
- Use programmatic guaranteed when inventory certainty is strategically important.
- If viewability is weak, adjust inventory, format, placement, and bidding before judging creative alone.
- If IVT is elevated, tighten supply paths and exclude suspicious inventory quickly.
- If frequency is too high for TOF, reduce caps or expand audience breadth.
- If reach is weak despite high spend, simplify structure or loosen overly restrictive filters.
- If click-through conversions look strong on upper-funnel display, validate with view-through context and downstream data.
- If pacing is front-loaded without a reason, review bid aggression, inventory concentration, and line-item settings.
- If first-party data is available, prioritize it over generic third-party audiences.

### Escalation triggers
- Serious brand safety or fraud issues appear.
- Floodlight or conversion tags are missing or misfiring.
- Data onboarding or DMP integration requires technical support.
- Cross-DSP discrepancy resolution needs central measurement input.
- Deal negotiations or inventory guarantees require activation lead involvement.
- Audio or CTV measurement limitations affect interpretation materially.
- Audience data usage raises privacy or contract questions.
- Client commitments depend on large budget reallocations.

## Marketing Context (WPPMedia)
### Agency operating context
- Assume a multi-client agency operating model with strategy, activation, analytics, finance, and client service stakeholders.
- Expect reporting cuts by client, market, brand, funnel stage, platform, audience, device, publisher, and fiscal period.
- Handle multiple currencies, tax treatments, and platform billing conventions when comparing spend and revenue.
- Separate platform-reported performance from modeled, deduplicated, or attributed business outcomes.
- Call out discrepancies caused by timezone, attribution window, identity resolution, or data freshness differences.
- Use naming conventions and taxonomy controls because agency environments depend on repeatable campaign metadata.
- Assume some clients optimize to leads or store visits rather than ecommerce revenue, so proxy metrics may matter.
- Balance statistical rigor with speed because media teams often need decisions before a campaign flight ends.
- Design outputs that can be reused in Power BI, spreadsheets, QBR packs, and client email summaries.
- Protect client confidentiality and avoid implying certainty when the data only supports directional guidance.
- Programmatic often plays a blended role across awareness and lower-funnel activity, so objective clarity is critical.
- WPPMedia teams may need one narrative across DV360, TTD, Amazon DSP, and direct buys.
- Inventory quality, brand safety, and fraud controls are especially important in client trust discussions.
- First-party audience activation is a strategic differentiator in programmatic planning.
- Programmatic reporting often requires more explanation because direct conversion attribution can be noisy.
- Cross-team coordination with ad ops, analytics, and verification partners is common.

### Client delivery expectations
- Lead with a short executive summary before showing tables or technical detail.
- Translate every analytical finding into a media or business implication.
- Provide recommended actions with expected impact, effort, owner, and timing.
- Highlight data caveats, missing inputs, and confidence levels.
- Use plain business language when speaking to non-technical stakeholders and technical detail when speaking to analysts.
- Distinguish confirmed root causes from hypotheses that still require testing.
- Prefer concise visuals, metric definitions, and segment summaries over dense dumps of raw rows.
- Package findings so they can be copied into decks, dashboards, or weekly status emails.

### Data governance expectations
- Confirm date ranges, currency, attribution model, and timezone before comparing datasets.
- Document joins, filters, exclusions, and any logic used to define brand, non-brand, prospecting, remarketing, or conversion classes.
- Validate that IDs, naming conventions, and taxonomy values match the expected business rules.
- Flag sampled data, modeled conversions, consent gaps, or missing tags before drawing conclusions.
- Check duplicate rows, fanout joins, and null handling when combining multiple sources.
- Avoid recommendations that rely on unapproved personal data use or weak consent foundations.
- Make sure formulas and snippets are production-safe, readable, and adaptable to a client environment.
- State when a recommendation should be socialized with platform specialists, engineering, legal, or measurement leads.

## Key Metrics & KPIs
### KPI reference
| Metric | Definition | How to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPM | Cost per one thousand impressions | Use with reach and quality metrics rather than alone. |
| vCPM | Viewable CPM | Useful when viewability quality matters more than raw CPM. |
| CTR | Clicks divided by impressions | Interpret differently by format and objective. |
| VTR | Video completions divided by video starts or impressions depending on source | Key video engagement KPI. |
| Viewability % | Share of measurable impressions that were viewable | Core quality KPI in display and video. |
| CPA | Cost per acquisition | Lower-funnel efficiency metric when tags are reliable. |
| ROAS | Revenue divided by spend | Use with attribution caveats in programmatic. |
| Reach | Unique users exposed | Important for awareness scale and frequency balance. |
| Frequency | Average impressions per user | Use for wear-out and overexposure control. |
| IVT % | Invalid traffic rate | Core traffic quality indicator. |
| Post-View Conversions | Conversions credited after an ad view | Interpret carefully and triangulate. |
| Floodlight Conversions | DV360-attributed conversions from Floodlight tags | Core DV360 measurement output. |

### Diagnostic thresholds and interpretation rules
- Low viewability with acceptable CPM can still be poor value if the campaign relies on quality attention.
- High CTR on low-quality supply can be a fraud or accidental-click signal rather than success.
- If IVT rises on a small set of supply sources, act quickly to exclude and contain.
- If frequency climbs but reach stalls, the campaign may be saturating a narrow audience.
- If premium deals cost more but also deliver better viewability and lower IVT, assess net business value rather than CPM alone.
- If post-view conversions dominate a campaign with weak click quality, communicate the uncertainty clearly.
- If line items underdeliver, check targeting tightness and deal availability before simply increasing bids.
- If front-loading causes spend spikes, evaluate whether the inventory is sufficiently time-sensitive to justify it.
- If Amazon DSP or retail media shows strong product detail page signals, interpret within the retailer ecosystem context.
- If cross-DSP reporting differs, standardize metric definitions before comparing performance.

### Common segment cuts
- DSP and buying platform.
- Deal type.
- Format: display, native, video, audio.
- Inventory source, exchange, site, or app.
- Audience type and first-party versus modeled.
- Device and environment.
- Market and geo.
- Prospecting versus remarketing.
- Click-through versus view-through conversion class.
- Daily pacing curve versus plan.
