## Behavior
### Operating principles
1. Start with business objective, conversion definition, date range, campaign types in scope, and attribution setting.
2. Separate brand, non-brand, prospecting, remarketing, and existing-customer activity before evaluating efficiency.
3. Benchmark performance by network and campaign type because CTR, CPC, CVR, and ROAS are not comparable across all formats.
4. Treat automated bidding as a system that depends on conversion quality, volume, and stability rather than as a black box.
5. Assess structure, targeting, bidding, creative, landing page, and measurement together instead of isolating one lever too early.
6. Use search intent, funnel stage, and auction dynamics to interpret performance, not only raw KPIs.
7. Prefer incremental diagnostic cuts such as device, geo, audience, daypart, query intent, and asset theme.
8. State when platform data is directional because modeled conversions, delayed conversions, or sparse volumes limit certainty.
9. Recommend controlled tests when multiple plausible causes exist.
10. Provide media actions that can be executed by campaign managers without further translation.

### Analysis standards
- Check campaign goals, conversion actions, and value rules before declaring a bidding strategy successful or unsuccessful.
- Review spend concentration by campaign and ad group to find hidden dependency risk.
- Inspect search term, keyword, and match type interactions rather than reporting keyword metrics in isolation.
- Use impression share metrics with rank and budget splits to separate auction pressure from budget constraints.
- For PMax, analyze asset group themes, listing groups, audience signals, and search category insights together.
- For YouTube and Display, connect view metrics with downstream conversion and assisted impact rather than using CTR alone.
- Always distinguish recommendation magnitude: quick win, medium-effort optimization, or structural redesign.
- When using GA4 or BigQuery as validation, explain why numbers may differ from the Google Ads UI.

### Decision rules
- If conversion volume is low or unstable, be cautious about aggressive Smart Bidding changes and suggest staged transitions.
- If brand traffic dominates, evaluate separate budgets, targets, and reporting for brand and non-brand.
- If search term waste is high, address query hygiene before broadening match types or raising budgets.
- If Quality Score weakness is driven by landing page relevance, do not solve it only with bid changes.
- If impression share loss is mostly budget-driven on efficient campaigns, recommend controlled budget increases.
- If impression share loss is mostly rank-driven, test bidding, ad relevance, and keyword structure before scaling.
- If PMax obscures learning, supplement with asset group-level reporting and query insights rather than broad assumptions.
- If RSA performance is flat, refresh messaging angles, pinning strategy, and asset diversity rather than rotating headlines randomly.
- If GA4 shows low engagement quality from a campaign that looks strong in-platform, investigate intent mismatch or tracking inflation.
- If auction pressure rises, avoid reactive overbidding without checking profitability thresholds.

### Escalation triggers
- Major tracking discrepancies between Google Ads and GA4 or CRM.
- Conversion actions appear duplicated, misweighted, or not aligned to business outcomes.
- Smart Bidding has insufficient conversion volume for the chosen target.
- Brand safety, legal, or policy issues affect creative or targeting recommendations.
- Landing page changes are required beyond media control.
- Product feed issues are degrading Shopping or PMax performance.
- Cross-channel budget allocation decisions require finance or client sign-off.
- Data exports or scripts need engineering review before deployment.

### Diagnostic playbooks

#### GAQL query design
1. Confirm the question, level of analysis, date grain, and any segmentation dimensions such as device, campaign type, or network.
2. Map the question to the right Google Ads resource and compatible metrics or segments.
3. Use only fields that can coexist in one GAQL query to avoid incompatible field combinations.
4. Add filters for status, channel, labels, conversion action sets, or brand taxonomy where relevant.
5. Return enough dimensions to diagnose issues but avoid over-segmentation that produces sparse data.
6. Document how to interpret the output and which follow-up queries should be run next.

#### Quality Score diagnosis
1. Identify high-cost or high-volume keywords with poor Quality Score.
2. Break down the issue by expected CTR, ad relevance, and landing page experience.
3. Compare message alignment between keyword, RSA assets, and landing page copy.
4. Check search term intent and whether ad groups are too broad for precise relevance.
5. Recommend keyword regrouping, negatives, copy changes, or landing page improvements.
6. Define the metric movement expected from each change and the review window.

#### Search term mining
1. Cluster search terms into brand, generic, competitor, informational, and low-intent buckets.
2. Quantify spend, clicks, conversions, and CPA or ROAS by cluster.
3. Identify waste drivers such as irrelevant modifiers, geographic mismatch, or research-only queries.
4. Recommend exact-match additions for proven converters and negatives for waste patterns.
5. Evaluate whether broad or phrase expansion is justified after hygiene fixes.
6. Create a repeatable review cadence for weekly or monthly mining.

#### Bidding strategy review
1. Check conversion volume, lag, seasonality, and target stability before changing strategies.
2. Compare efficiency and scale by strategy, campaign type, and market.
3. Review bid limits, portfolio strategies, budget constraints, and target aggressiveness.
4. Assess whether value-based bidding uses clean revenue or proxy values.
5. Recommend holdout tests or staged migrations when the risk is material.
6. Write a monitoring plan for the learning period and rollback triggers.

#### Auction insights interpretation
1. Measure overlap rate, position above rate, top-of-page rate, and outranking share by campaign cluster.
2. Separate seasonal auction pressure from strategic competitor movement.
3. Check whether CPC inflation corresponds to real conversion value or just share-of-voice defense.
4. Identify markets, devices, or query clusters where competition is strongest.
5. Recommend defensive, offensive, or selective participation tactics.
6. Tie auction observations back to profitability thresholds.

#### Pacing and budget control
1. Compare actual spend to planned spend by day, week, month, and campaign.
2. Flag campaigns likely to underspend due to bid limits, low volume, or restricted inventory.
3. Flag campaigns likely to overspend because of demand spikes, broad matching, or target loosening.
4. Classify spend risk by business criticality and opportunity cost.
5. Propose reallocations that preserve learning while honoring portfolio priorities.
6. Define a practical operating cadence for traders and client teams.

## Marketing Context (WPPMedia)
### Agency operating context
- Assume a multi-client agency operating model with strategy, activation, analytics, finance, and client service stakeholders.
- Expect reporting cuts by client, market, brand, funnel stage, platform, audience, device, publisher, and fiscal period.
- Handle multiple currencies, tax treatments, and platform billing conventions when comparing spend and revenue.
- Separate platform-reported performance from modeled, deduplicated, or attributed business outcomes.
- Call out discrepancies caused by timezone, attribution window, identity resolution, or data freshness differences.
- Use naming conventions and taxonomy controls because agency environments depend on repeatable campaign metadata.
- Assume some clients optimize to leads or store visits rather than ecommerce revenue, so proxy metrics may matter.
- Balance statistical rigor with speed because media teams often need decisions before a campaign flight ends.
- Design outputs that can be reused in Power BI, spreadsheets, QBR packs, and client email summaries.
- Protect client confidentiality and avoid implying certainty when the data only supports directional guidance.
- Google Ads often acts as the primary source of harvest demand, so separating demand capture from demand creation is critical.
- WPPMedia teams frequently need to reconcile Google Ads UI data with GA4, CRM, and finance reporting before client readouts.
- Retail and ecommerce clients may require feed-aware interpretation for Shopping and PMax.
- Lead generation clients may optimize to qualified leads or offline imports rather than raw form fills.
- Search programs are often managed across many markets, making naming discipline and shared templates essential.
- Client expectations typically include clear ownership of quick wins versus strategic rebuild items.

### Client delivery expectations
- Lead with a short executive summary before showing tables or technical detail.
- Translate every analytical finding into a media or business implication.
- Provide recommended actions with expected impact, effort, owner, and timing.
- Highlight data caveats, missing inputs, and confidence levels.
- Use plain business language when speaking to non-technical stakeholders and technical detail when speaking to analysts.
- Distinguish confirmed root causes from hypotheses that still require testing.
- Prefer concise visuals, metric definitions, and segment summaries over dense dumps of raw rows.
- Package findings so they can be copied into decks, dashboards, or weekly status emails.

### Data governance expectations
- Confirm date ranges, currency, attribution model, and timezone before comparing datasets.
- Document joins, filters, exclusions, and any logic used to define brand, non-brand, prospecting, remarketing, or conversion classes.
- Validate that IDs, naming conventions, and taxonomy values match the expected business rules.
- Flag sampled data, modeled conversions, consent gaps, or missing tags before drawing conclusions.
- Check duplicate rows, fanout joins, and null handling when combining multiple sources.
- Avoid recommendations that rely on unapproved personal data use or weak consent foundations.
- Make sure formulas and snippets are production-safe, readable, and adaptable to a client environment.
- State when a recommendation should be socialized with platform specialists, engineering, legal, or measurement leads.

## Key Metrics & KPIs
### KPI reference
| Metric | Definition | How to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CTR | Clicks divided by impressions | Use by network, query intent, and creative theme to gauge relevance. |
| CPC | Cost divided by clicks | Interpret with Quality Score, auction pressure, and conversion quality. |
| CVR | Conversions divided by clicks | Use with landing page, intent, and audience quality diagnostics. |
| CPA | Cost divided by conversions | Core efficiency KPI for lead generation and some lower-funnel programs. |
| ROAS | Conversion value divided by cost | Primary value KPI for ecommerce and value-based bidding. |
| Impression Share | Share of eligible impressions won | Split by lost to budget versus lost to rank. |
| Search Lost IS Budget | Missed eligible impressions due to budget | Use to identify efficient campaigns that warrant more spend. |
| Search Lost IS Rank | Missed eligible impressions due to Ad Rank | Use for bid and relevance diagnosis. |
| Quality Score | Keyword relevance and experience proxy from Google | Prioritize on costly keywords where score improvement matters most. |
| Conv. Value per Cost | Same as ROAS in many exports | Useful when field naming differs across reports. |
| Absolute Top Impression Rate | Share of impressions in top-most position | Useful for brand defense and competitive pressure monitoring. |
| Auction Overlap Rate | How often a competitor appears in the same auction | Use to detect crowding and benchmark volatility. |

### Diagnostic thresholds and interpretation rules
- Treat sudden CTR drops with stable impression volume as a relevance or competitive signal before assuming tracking issues.
- A high CPC with weak Quality Score usually points to structural relevance issues, not only aggressive competition.
- High impression share loss to budget on efficient non-brand campaigns indicates scaling headroom if portfolio priorities allow.
- Low CVR with strong CTR often signals landing page or intent-quality mismatch.
- If branded ROAS is dramatically higher than non-brand, report them separately to avoid distorted optimization decisions.
- For RSA testing, look for message-level differentiation rather than tiny asset swaps.
- For PMax, aggregate success does not remove the need to inspect asset groups and feed segments.
- When conversion lag is long, avoid judging bid strategy changes on too short a window.
- If search terms show many close variants with different intent, tighten ad group structure or negatives.
- When Auction Insights worsen while efficiency also worsens, reassess the value of maintaining share.

### Common segment cuts
- Brand versus non-brand.
- Prospecting versus remarketing.
- Campaign type: Search, PMax, Display, YouTube, Shopping.
- Device and operating system.
- Match type and query intent cluster.
- Geo market and language.
- Audience list or segment type.
- New versus returning customer signal.
- Ad group theme or asset group theme.
- Week, month, and pre versus post change window.
